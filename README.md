# ggpolar

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

ggpolar supplies a few ggplot2 facilities to plot the data in polar
coordinate on the layer of cartesian coordinate.

## Installation

By now, ggpolar has not been submitted to cran. You can try the
development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("microly/ggpolar")
```

## Usage

1.You can map radius and theta data to the plot directly.

``` r
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpolar)

polar_data <- tibble(theta = 1:360, radius = theta)

# use StatPolar
ggplot(polar_data) + 
    geom_path(aes(p_theta = theta, p_radius = radius), stat = "polar")
```

``` r

# use with_polar, which is a layer modifier
ggplot(polar_data) + 
    with_polar(geom_path(aes(p_theta = theta, p_radius = radius)))
#> Warning: Ignoring unknown aesthetics: p_theta, p_radius
```

<img src="man/figures/README-map_radius_theta-2.png" width="50%" />

``` r

# the way to suppress the warning "Ignoring unknown aesthetics: p_theta, p_radius":
ggplot(polar_data, aes(p_theta = theta, p_radius = radius)) + 
    with_polar(geom_path())
```

2.You can also translate and(or) rotate the data before the mapping
process.

3.Data can be interpolated automatically, so you can draw arcs and
sectors as easily as draw lines and polygons.

4.With the help of some layer functions (geom\_plar\_axis,
geom\_polar\_ring and geom\_polar\_bar), you can draw the polar
coordinate based plots (eg. radar plot, pie plot and Nightingale rose
diagram ) in a more intuitively way.
