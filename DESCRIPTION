Title: A ggplot2 Extension to Plot Data in Polar Coordinates on a Cartesian Layer
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Yu", "Liu", , "microly@foxmail.com", c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A few ggplot2 facilities to plot data in polar coordinates on a cartesian layer. Firstly, 
    you can plot radius and theta to a cartesian layer directly, and also translate and/or rotate the data
    (and/or the whole layer). Secondly, data can be interpolated automatically, so you can draw arcs 
    and sectors as easily as draw lines and polygons. Tirdly, with the help of some layer functions 
    , you can draw the polar coordinates based plots (eg. radar plot, pie chart and Nightingale rose 
    diagram) in a more intuitively way.
