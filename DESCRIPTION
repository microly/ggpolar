Title: A ggplot2 Extension to Plot the Data in Polar Coordinate on the Layer of Cartesian Coordinate.
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Yu", "Liu", , "microly@foxmail.com", c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A few ggplot2 facilities to plot the data in polar coordinateon on the layer of cartesian 
    coordinate. Firstly, you can map radius and theta data to the plot directly, and translate and(or) 
    rotate the data before the mapping process. Secondly, data can be interpolated automatically, so you 
    can draw arcs and sectors as easily as draw lines and polygons. Tirdly, with the help of some layer 
    functions (geom_plar_axis, geom_polar_ring and geom_polar_bar), you can draw the polar coordinate based 
    plots (eg. radar plot, pie plot and Nightingale rose diagram ) in a more intuitively way.
